# hw one
- "ok create a project" in github featuring a boilerplate `index.html` file and a `readme.md` file
- second thing, if you want to try to style your `MD` a pretty good reference is `dillinger.io`
- third thing, go ahead and use an `HTML boilerplate` and just copy paste the code online. Having to manually type in a blank `HTML` document is crude an a waste of your time.

## how do you expect me to even do this?
1. log into your `GitHub`
2. click the `+` in the upper right and `select` `Create New Repo`
3. call the repo `homework1`
3. initialize that `Repo` with a `Readme.MD` file by `pressing the right checkbox during the creation screen`

1. now we want to work on the `boilerplate`
2. find a `HTML5` boilerplate online or use this one
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>title</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```
3. press `create new file` from the `github.com` new repo page you just created
4. call that file `index.html`
5. paste in the `boilerplate`
6. profit

# day 3

# Lesson 4

What happened in class Review

- HTML `<textarea>` Tag: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_textarea.asp

- List of all HTML5 allowed imput types, yes even color: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp

Homework:
- add an image to your `index.html` file with the `img` tag.
- find an `URL` of an `image` on the `internet` somehwere and copy paste that `url` into the `src=""` part of your `img' tag in order to display said image in a `JS bin`
- do this in `JS bin` first so you can check that it works, and when you are done paste it into your `index.html` on `GitHub` thus updating that file.
- your index.html file should now have an `image` in it as well as all the former things
- don't worry about where the image is physically in the file, just put it somewhere that looks good

Homework part two (2):
- take a screen shot of you succesfully `web instpecting` the image found on a regular site, like maybe, [ "nytimes", "nypost", "espn", or something like that]

# Lesson 6
Homework is to find images online, `hack` the width using the method below so that way you can use an image you found even if its too large.

Combine various `html` elements, such as `ul` `li` `p` `span` `h1` & `div`'s in order to make your image mellee. Use at least 10 (ten) images and use `all` of the `html` elements above, keeping in mind if they are `block` or `inline`.

Here are the links to the `block` v `inline`
[block elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements)

[inline elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements)

Homework

- make your own website
- **always start with** a `index.html` page and additional `something.html` and more if you feel comfortable
- make a `image` folder and `download` about 7 (seven) images off the web to use there a handfull of images, so keep them in _all in_ there
- make `relative` links to the images
- make sure you make the `navbar` **important** using `ul` `li` and `a tags` I don't care if it just looks like a bulleted list of links, I can show you how that gets _stylized_ in order to make look right later, just do the basics now.
- make `relative` links to the other `html` files using a `navbar`
- **use layout on page** `432` of the book

How do I turn this in?
- since you made this website in it's own `folder` probably on your desktop...
- go to your homework repo
- `click` on `upload files`
- **drag** the folder from your desktop to this window, then click `upload`
- then it will show the `foldername` in your repo all nice and you can click around in there to verify

# Lesson 8

- Objective: add more things to your `mini_site`
- Objective: use `github` the right way

Todo's
1. add more things to site
2. Make a `git commit` and `push` `master branch` to the `git origin` which is your online repo

# Lesson 9

- Intro to css

- Homework:
- add a css file to your `mini_site`
- `source` that file in your header
- (browse that codebase from class here)[https://github.com/zackn9ne/module1_set1/tree/master/temp_proj]

** mini git workflow **

`if pull request`

- go on `github.com`
- accept `pull request`
- `git pull`

`if pull requests are all fixed`

- do `coding`
- `git add -A .`
- `git commit -m "commit message"`
- `git push origin master`

# Session 10

- https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/vm-vh-units
- http://apex.sh/ping/
- http://www.cssmania.com/

** homework **

- utilise page `413` to add a background image to a div, remember to get the path of the image right, something like `../images/image_name.jpg`
- utilise font family on page `273`, use a font stack from there on one or all of your elements, probably start with the `body` and it will `cascade` down.
- or if your feeling fun you can use a commonly accepted font stack from here http://www.cssfontstack.com/

# Session 11

- http://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow
- `border-radius: 10px;`
- https://fonts.google.com/

*** homework **

- make a new `html` document in your repo called `div_time.html`
- wire up a `style.css file` to it in a `/css` directory
- I don't care about images for now
- you _have to_ use the following divs
- make `two` `.feature` `div's` `display: inline-block;` `margin: 0 auto;` and `width: 300px;`, remember to _force it to be this way_
- make `five` div's total on the page, `header` `hero` `footer` are all `100% width` so they will be easy
- put `box shadows` on some div's
- put `border-radius` on all div's
- put `borders` on divs

```
|
|________ header div ___________

|
|_________ hero div ____________

   |__feature__| |__feature__|

|
|_________ footer div ___________
```

# class 15 intro to JS

`DOMContentLoaded` https://codepen.io/LukeAskew/pen/LnJsE

_homework_

study this `index.html` found here to learn how to wire up your `app.js` file https://github.com/zackn9ne/module1_set1/tree/master/js_ex1

1. wire up a `index.html`
2. wire up a `js` folder
3. wire up a `js/app.js` file
4. dont worry about `css file` _seriously, just dont'_
5. put all the following `JS` in your _brand new_ `js/app.js` file. Go with the most `basic` `js method` I can think of which is:
6.

```
    document.write("Hello World!");

```

7. optional: add a `JS` alert
8. **DOM Ready** is awesome, attempt this 100% you must attempt. Info on DOM Ready https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded:

```
// post DOM loaded
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){

// put code that waits for DOM


}, false);
```

# class 16 JS Episode 2

- How to add `CSS` to an element with `JS` http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_style.asp, the thing about this page is that if you scroll to the bottom is where all the cool things you can do via `JS` to your `CSS` are so try some.

_homework_

- If you didn't do `15` you better do it
- If you _did_ do `15`:


a. use `document.getElementByID`

b. use `.style` **method** in order to apply some `css` to the element you targeted in `a`

- Heres what you need to do:

```
document.getElementById('yourElement').style.SOMETHING = 'somevalue';
```
